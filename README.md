This study introduces two attention-based neural network models for cognitive modeling of individual human decision-making in dynamic settings. Tested on datasets from phishing email detection and cybersecurity attack scenarios, these models outperform Instance Based Learning (IBL) and GPT3.5 in representing human decision-making. The research also reveals that all models predict decisions more accurately for humans who perform better at the task. The study also explores decision explanations based on the model's predictive factors, offering promising insights for future applications of neural networks in cognitive modeling of human decision-making.
